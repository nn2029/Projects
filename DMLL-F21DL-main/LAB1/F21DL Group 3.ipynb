    "\n",
    "The dataset is generally obtained from a satellite called MODIS based on hotspots of forest fire in Turkey. There are totally 36,011 records/instances in the dataset with each row pertaining to the satellite readings within a specific time interval. The columns represent 15 attributes/features. The target feature is the 'confidence' which helps to gauge the quality of the hotspot/fire. The 'confidence ' attribute is logged in terms of percentage, which can be represented as a nominal data with three categories Low, Nominal/Medium and High. This dataset can be used to train a model to predict whether the confidence of the forest fire is Low, Nominal or High.\n",
