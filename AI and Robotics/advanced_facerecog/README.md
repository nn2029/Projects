Facial Recognition Project

Project Description

This project utilizes the power of OpenCV and the face_recognition library to perform facial recognition on images. The system works by encoding faces from a dataset and then uses these encodings to recognize faces in other images.

Installation

This project requires Python 3.7 or later. Additional dependencies include OpenCV, face_recognition, and dlib. To install the necessary libraries, run the following command:

pip install opencv-python face_recognition dlib numpy

Usage

Encoding Faces: Modify the embedding.py script to point to your dataset of images. Each image should contain one face and be named with the name of the person in the image. Run the script to create the encodings.
python embedding.py
Recognizing Faces: Run the recognition.py script to start the facial recognition process. This script will use the webcam feed to recognize faces in real-time based on the encodings generated by the embedding.py script.
python recognition.py
